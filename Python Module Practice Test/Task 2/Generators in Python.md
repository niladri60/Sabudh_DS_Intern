## Topic 2: Generators in Python

### Description

In this assignment, you will be exploring the concept of generators in Python. Generators are a powerful feature of Python that allow you to iterate over a sequence of values without creating the entire sequence in memory.

### Task 2

1. **Write a generator function** that generates the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. Test your function by printing out the first 10 numbers in the sequence.

2. **Write a generator function** that generates all the prime numbers up to `n`. Test your function by printing out all the prime numbers up to 100.

3. **Write a generator function** that takes a string as input and generates all the words in the string. Test your function by generating all the words in the following string: `"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."`

4. **Write a generator function** that takes a list of strings as input and generates all the unique words in the list. Test your function by generating all the unique words in the following list: `["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]`

5. **Write a generator function** that takes a list of integers as input and generates all the sublists of length `n`. Test your function by generating all the sublists of length 3 from the following list: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
