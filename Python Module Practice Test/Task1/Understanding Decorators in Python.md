## Topic 1: Understanding Decorators in Python

### Description

This assignment will focus on understanding the concept of decorators in Python. A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument, modifies its behavior, and returns the modified function. In Python, decorators are a powerful tool that allows you to modify the behavior of functions or classes.

### Objective

- Understand the concept of decorators in Python.
- Learn how to create decorators in Python.
- Learn how to apply decorators to functions and classes.

### TASK 1

1. **Create a new Python file called `decorators.py`.**
   
2. **Define a function called `uppercase_decorator`** that takes another function as an argument, modifies its behavior, and returns the modified function. The modified function should convert the result of the original function to uppercase.

3. **Define a function called `say_hello`** that takes a name as an argument and returns a greeting string.

4. **Apply the `uppercase_decorator` to the `say_hello` function** and assign the modified function to a new variable called `greet`.

5. **Test the `greet` function** by calling it with a name argument and printing the result.

6. **Define a new decorator function called `timing_decorator`** that takes another function as an argument, modifies its behavior, and returns the modified function. The modified function should measure and print the time it takes to run the original function.

7. **Apply the `timing_decorator` to the `greet` function** and assign the modified function to a new variable called `timed_greet`.

8. **Test the `timed_greet` function** by calling it with a name argument and printing the result.

9. **Define a class called `Math`** with two methods: `add` and `subtract`. Both methods should take two arguments and return the result of adding or subtracting them.

10. **Define a new decorator function called `logging_decorator`** that takes another function as an argument, modifies its behavior, and returns the modified function. The modified function should log the arguments and the result of the original function to the console.

11. **Apply the `logging_decorator` to the `Math` class methods** and test them by creating an instance of the class and calling the methods with some arguments.

12. **Submit the `decorators.py` file** with all the code and comments explaining each step.

**Note:** Make sure to follow the best practices for naming conventions and code style in Python.
