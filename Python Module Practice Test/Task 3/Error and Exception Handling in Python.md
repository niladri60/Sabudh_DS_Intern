## TOPIC 3: Error and Exception Handling in Python

### Description

In this assignment, you will practice handling errors and exceptions in Python, including creating and raising custom exceptions.

### Task 3

1. **Write a Python program** that prompts the user to enter two numbers, then divides the first number by the second number and prints the result.

2. **Use a try-except block** to catch any `ZeroDivisionError` that might occur when dividing the numbers. Print an error message to the user instead of the result.

3. **Create a custom exception** called `NegativeNumberError` that raises an error message when a negative number is entered.

4. **Modify your program** to raise a `NegativeNumberError` if the user enters a negative number. Handle the exception using a try-except block and print the error message to the user.

5. **Use the else block** to print the result if no exceptions are raised.

6. **Use the finally block** to print a message to the user, indicating the end of the program execution.
